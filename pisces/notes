If you update npm itself, do NOT use the npm update command.
The upstream-recommended way to update npm is:
  npm install -g npm@latest

You can use brew with sudo, but only if the brew executable is owned by root.
However, this is both not recommended and completely unsupported so do so at
your own risk.

ammathew owns /usr/local/Cellar , not root
thought root had access to everything
appears not to be the case

Found Xcode project pisces.xcodeproj
Usage: simctl list [devices|devicetypes|runtimes]

Could not parse the simulator list output

I just want to say that I had the same issue on version 6.4 and the specific problem is that it doesn't support the command "xcrun simctl list --json devices" which is what the node module runs under the hood (yes, I debugged the node module!!). You need to upgrade XCode to fix the problem. I upgraded to 7.2.1 (because I'm on Tosemite) and it fixed the problem. Hope this saves someone time!

trying to download xcode 7.2.1
