** DONE add in column separator

is this in TimeBased.pm?
when warning out $headers in sub _gen_headers

    {
                           'width' => '2',
                           'name' => 'blank',
                           'key' => 'blank'
                         },

how is this empty header inserted?

already defined in $column_headers

what is self->column_headers?

lib/SocialFlow/Tabular.pm

log out stuff in above file...

blank is defined in $sheet_headers

has 'column_headers' => ( is => 'rw', isa => 'HashRef', default => sub { {} } );
in Tabular.pm



** DONE add in %likes change and in %followers average per message

included in rollups for other metrics:
https://github.com/SocialFlowDev/SocialFlow-Tabular/blob/ammathew.add_reach_and_likes_to_reports/lib/SocialFlow/Tabular/TimeBased.pm

*** how were these t`hings done for other reports?


sub _span_averages 

*** add in average because appears to be there already

**** add to yml and _span_averages function and see jf it just works out of the box

'redis-1.dev:7000

set SOCIALFLOW_WEB_PATH as redis1.dev:7000, still not working...

could not connect to Redis server at redis-1.dev:7000

do i even need to run worker on dev-home?

how did I do this before?

ammathew [3:28 PM] 
anyone know what redis server im supposed to use in work_queue_redis on dev home?

[3:28] 
i tried could not connect to Redis server at redis-1.dev:7000

[3:28] 
i mean redis-1.dev:7000

[3:29] 
job-queue.dev.saturn.sfsrv.net:7003 fwiw

[3:29] 
guru?

ok, i think i never actually tested with prod data, just columns rendered, with zero values, on accound of changes to sf-web on dev-home

** DONE ok, just test on QNTM

Argument "n/a" isn't numeric in subtraction (-) at /home/ammathew/to_devel_local/SocialFlow-Tabular/lib/SocialFlow/Tabular/TimeBased.pm line 533, <GEN1> line 2.

*** DONE seems that likes channge percent is not being calculated properly

maybe something to do with this error:
Argument "n/a" isn't numeric in subtraction (-) at /home/ammathew/to_devel_local/SocialFlow-Tabular/lib/SocialFlow/Tabular/TimeBased.pm line 533, <GEN1> line 2.

**** but wrong in other columns too?

check on prod

ammathew [4:25 PM] 
do clients ever complain about time based reports ( dod, wow,mom ) not having correct values for change %'s ... because when they go down they def look wrong ...

[4:25] 
on prod

this is an issue on prod. can fix on prod?





**** fix  change in percentage issue

 $last_span != 0
          ? ( ( $this_span - $last_span ) / $last_span ) * 100
          : 'n/a';

wont calculate if last span 0? but last span is often 0?

sub _span_changes

fine at $span_rollup->{"percent_$_"} ...something done with the columns upon rendering?

    $self->report_structure(
        $self->_report_structure( $span_rollups, \@span_epochs ) );

maybe something to do with how preview is rendering? try on google docs

ok, it is just a matter of how preview is rendering negative percentages?

**** percentage change is sometimees a string, sometime a number?


*** TODO how to put in an empty column separator?


*** no likes average per message? 







** TODO rearrange average per message and change % to be consistant with other measures

** TODO prepare update to PR

only is sf-web...just checkout the 3 ymls from development branch...

* other concerns
** "like_or_favorite" designation ala TimeBased.pm L555
** why
