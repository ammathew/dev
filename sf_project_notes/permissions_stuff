why bein redirected to publish after inviting user?


** functionu

h you did write that method sort of

[3:54]  
_social_account_admin_client_services

[3:54]  
in  lib/SocialFlow/Web/Controller/API/ClientService.pm

[3:55]  
so you could pretty must copy that to appuser or client

[3:55]  
i guess you'd do something like my( $self, $client ) = @_ in Appuser

[3:56]  
then you could do $user->social_account_admin_client_services

** check capability rather than role?





** TODO change has social account admin rol to has social account admin capability

why cant find page?

how was template served before?

2 controllers sharing a function??

need to revisti above later

for now

http://ammathew.home.saturn.sflow.us:4010/settings/social_account_admin/edit_user_permissions/210  404ing?

working but name and email not being written out


what happened to old edit_user_permissions

where is code excluding admins etc from list of editable users?

social account admin should have no access to admin


why does "read only" state stick on SAA dashboard when editing for client admin, but still has all privilidges ( as it should  );

why is resend invite there?

use new sf web schema method to list of client services in SAA dash?

is there a has_max_role function?

manage_client_service_accounts capability?

joe [6:00 PM]  
so like

[6:00]  
you can have PathPart: link_shortening

[6:00]  
but in the nav yml it's going by action path

[6:00]  
so as far as nav yml is concerned it's like linkshortening/base_index

[6:00]  
and when generating the nav it will use the correct PathPart



change the user_permissions_social_account_admin endpoint?


change implies roles? 



should the enpoints now at settings/user_permissions and settings/user_permission_social_account_admin share an endpoint?


take another look at has_social_account_admin_role function?


cleanup appuser.pm ( my does $self->role_vals return undef? )



* NEXT  how about if social account gets deleted??



* NEXT


$self->_can_edit_user???


add in validation for client  user permissioned

* access to http://ammathew.home.saturn.sflow.us:4010/settings/admin/users_permissions/edit_user_permissions_social_account_admin/220  page for example needs to be validated and needs to redirect


* TODO resend invite doesnt work on client now
orm_error: {msgid: "invalid_form", message: "social_account_admin capability required"



so, social account admin is above admin of client service, below account admin


social accout admin definately in client service, not client


{form_error: {msgid: "invalid_form", message: "social_account_admin capability required"},â€¦}


is admin role anywhere on  client role table




ammathew [4:36 PM]  
hey u around?

[4:36]  
about this:

https://github.com/SocialFlowDev/SocialFlow-Web/blob/master/SocialFlow-Web-Config/lib/auto/share/dist/SocialFlow-Web-Config/etc/shared/controllers/api/api_settings.yml#L95

[4:37]  
the social account admin needs the ability to resend invites right

[4:37]  
but i'd need some sort of "or" validation there right

[4:37]  
Validate::Client::MinimumRole::Admin  or Validate::ClientService::MinimumRole::SocialAccountAdmin

[4:38]  
would it be ok to just move that validation to the code?

[4:38]  
like in sub resend_invite ?



* TODO cleanup

shousl I change some of the paths?
settings/social_account_admin ?

api/settings/user_permissions_social_account_admin:

cant on prod

no need to send full name etc through fron end?

it's all in a form...

social account admin hasthe capability TODO_CABABILITY_admin, so why doesnt it show up on edit_user_permissions_social_account_admin.html ?
has only that capability on client service?

The schema should not require a catalyst object to do anything, the schema should be self contained when it comes to determining permissions and such, could you reformulate this so it takes a $client object or a resultset of client services instead? I would think take a client, because the method is really does this user on this client have any capability to be a social account admin.

this uers on this client
currentlly, has_social_account_admin_capability calls social_account_admin_client_services 
which uses client_services stashed in a catalyst object...

return 1 if any { $_ eq $capability_name } map { @{ $caps->capabilities_for_role( $self->role_name($_) ) // [] } }  $appuser_client_service->roles->get_column('role_id')->all;

got through and change has_social_account_admin capability to
$self->has_capability_within_client( 'social_account_admin', 4 )

This seems unneccesary, you already have @users, why reassign it to the same value? SAA.pm L30

I don't believe so.  My recollection is that it's actually the number of
IDs available before we have to write another WAL log entry for the
sequence.  So unless you're using a replication method that can get at
WAL entries, it's a non-issue.

joe [3:43 PM]  
i think all of that has_role stuff was deprecated in favor of the has_capability stuff

[3:43]  
since the idea was that the roles themselves would no longer matter

[3:43]  
it would be more about what you are able to do

[3:43]  
since the roles are collections of capabilities

hey...should social account admins have the right to revoke users?

[2:51]  
like, what do they have the ability to do after they invite users to a social account and the user accepts?

new messages
matt [3:05 PM]  
well they could remove them from the social accoun tyeah

[3:05]  
they could change their permissions on the account

[3:06]  
they can't remove users from the client though

ammathew [3:06 PM]  
i see ...even though they were the ones who invited them to the client, right?


matt [3:07 PM]  
well the users might get rights added on other social accounts no? sam seemed to think it was a constraint because of our existing architecture


ammathew [3:09 PM]  
never actually looked that that use case

[3:09]  
lms


ammathew [3:10 PM]  
so is the client admin the only one who has the right to add users to the client?

[3:10]  
and then the social account admin invites to the social account

[3:11]  
?

[3:11]  
right now the social account admin can invite anybody

matt [3:11 PM]  
no i think the social account admin has to be able to add users to client

[3:11]  
to get them to the social account

[3:11]  
I think that wa sin the spec

[3:11]  
we wrote up

[3:12]  
and Sam spoke about it a bunch

[3:12]  
but they probably shouldn't be able to remove from client

[3:12]  
anyway thats what it seemed to net out to

[3:12]  
but if in investigating it -that makes no sense

[3:12]  
let me know

ammathew [4:05 PM]  
hey ...talked to pat

[4:05]  
ammathew [2:56 PM]  
hey ... have a question ... on the "User Details and Permissions" page...  where the social accounts are listed out ... do u know if anyone actually uses the admin radio button?

[2:56]  
sam and matt didnt know what setting a social account permission to admin did

patspeiser [3:56 PM]  
yeah people use that one

[3:56]  
the admin radio button allows a user to edit the social accounts settings as well as re-authorize the account

ammathew [3:59 PM]  
oh ..  so im working on adding a social account admin role ( can invite new users to a subset of social accounts on the client ) ... im thinking of making that permissions tier like a subset of that admin tier ... like all admins on a social account can invite new users to it

[3:59]  
dont know how that sits with u

[3:59]  
ill copy and paste this chat over to matt

new messages
patspeiser [4:00 PM]  
omg we're finally making that permission level?!

[4:00]  
I can still remember the meeting where our first project manager permission said we didn't need it. Haha

[4:01]  
Should just make that admin role the ability to add users to that account

ammathew [4:01 PM]  
yea come to think of it i dont really get why there needs to be a separate admin and social_account_admin role

[4:02]  
why not just let admins invite new users?

patspeiser [4:02 PM]  
yeah im sure someone will have a reason

[4:03]  
there were two things always missing frmo user permissions

[4:03]  
1) A user needs to be able to be delegated a number of social accounts they're allowed to add. Like - this dude can add 10.

[4:03]  
2) That user should be able to invite new users and assign their permissions out to the accounts they have access to

ammathew [4:04 PM]  
but how about reauthng/settings etc

[4:04]  
i guess there might be a good reason for that to be a separate (higher?) permission tier

[4:04]  
the second one i feel like im almost done with building out

[4:04]  
unless im missing something

[4:06]  
so... make admin a higher permission tier that includes social_account_admin ?

matt [4:06 PM]  
If pay is cool with it o think yeah

[4:06]  
Oh wait slack error

[4:07]  
I didn't get the whole message reading now

matt [4:07 PM]  
Hey so

[4:08]  
Yeah I agree it could all be admin

[4:08]  
But I didn't know what it did or where it was set or if pat thought it would eff anything up

[4:08]  
But if not it would be better if they were the same thing

ammathew [4:08 PM]  
i can kind of understand making it separate...like admin can  create groups etc

matt [4:09 PM]  
Ok

new messages
[4:09]  
Then separate lol

ammathew [4:10 PM]  
hold on, im checking what else  admin can do that social account admin cant currently

[4:12]  
does that work, or should they be combined?

[4:12]  
i can see client admin not wanting to bother with that stuff

[4:12]  
wanting to delegate it to a social account admin

** TODO make all admins social account admins

** dont think i need that?
** what is difference between admin and account_admin?
** add social account admin to nav bar?

what is client_role?

** TODO how do groups fit into all of this?
   
** NEXT cleanup
   
** social account admin is a permissions level above admin. is this reflected int config files, and the broader ap[p?

what is role account_admin ... is is used?

if set to social_account_admin, then lose reauth account capability 

Account Admin - Can add and remove social accounts and add, edit, and remove users.

 TODO_CAPABILITY_account_admin is only in config files

looks messed up. ammathew+6 was set to read/write on one account, social account admin in another, can still reauth both...  also, no menu shortcut for social_account_admin?

just added TODO_CAPABILITY_admin as capability under the social_account admin role, why would I have to do this?

imples roles... 

shouldnt be able to add groups

manage_client_service_accounts?

not anywhere...


      implies_roles:

why does SAA have ability to edit groups etc?


so "admin" role can be on client or on social account??
if on client, then can add groups, add accounts etc?


for access to social account admin, need to check if admin on at least one account... CANNOT PUT THIS ON CLIENT TABLE


** need a way to check if user is SAA for at least on eaccount, so that SAA menu bar option appears


client_role:  ??




removing client_role param in nav bar config, and menu item appeards

where is this config parsed?
can I a new method to it?

$has_user_role = first { $user_obj->has_user_role($_) } @$user_roles;




* not doing

** combine admin and social account admin


** add in select all to be social account admin 



** make social account admin less than admin?

CANT edit group, CANT add a social account

ability to be BOTH SAA and Admin? 

admin can not currently invite user to account


social account admin can not delete accounts/add accounts/reauth

client role..

* "missing default permissions" bug?

* write up


Users can now be "User Admins", which means that Client Admins can put certain users in charge of of inviting users to specific social accounts and set their permissions on those social accounts.

what User Admins CAN do:

can invite users to a particular social account
can set permissions foe users on those accounts (eg: read, write, admin ). 

what they CANT do:

add new social accounts
delete users who were already invited

THINGS TO TEST:
1) logged in as client admin, invite new user and set to social account admin
settings->admin->users and permissions->invite new user 
set to User Admin

2) accept invite and log in
the new User Admin should be able to invite new users and set their permissions
settings->user admin->invite new user


3) user admin can change permissions for any users on social accounts they are admin of
settings->user admin->edit (a particular user)->save

instead of pulling the list of services _from_ the list of campaigns,


new messages
[4:40]  
you could: grep { has_access_to_service( $_ ) } qw/ ads_facebook_ad_account ads_twitter_account ads_pinterest_account /;

[4:40]  
sand then just limit the campaign_set->campaigns query to that list of supported_service_ids (edited)
