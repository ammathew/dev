ryan [3:55 PM]  
did you get the feed_fetcher and content importer working

ammathew [3:56 PM]  
er, no

[3:56]  
any tips

ryan [3:56 PM]  
whats the issue?

ammathew [3:57 PM]  
might have something to do with redis

ryan [3:57 PM]  
you definitely need redis running

ammathew [3:57 PM]  
content importer not seeing the fetched feeds

ryan [3:57 PM]  
are you running both locally?

[3:58]  
acutally all three workers?

ammathew [3:58 PM]  
u mean  running a redis server too

[3:58]  
actually not

ryan [3:58 PM]  
feed fetcher -> feed fetcher â€”db_writer -> content_importer

[3:58]  
plus redis (edited)

ammathew [3:58 PM]  
i was looking through the code

[3:58]  
db writer huh

[3:58]  
didnt have that up

ryan [3:58 PM]  
thats the link

[3:59]  
ill link you

[3:59]  
https://github.com/SocialFlowDev/sf-deploy-application/blob/master/application/FeedFetcher/supervisor.tt

[3:59]  
need both of those running

ammathew [3:59 PM]  
i see

[3:59]  
ill try that

[3:59]  
thanks

ryan [3:59 PM]  
https://github.com/SocialFlowDev/sf-deploy-application/blob/master/application/ContentImporter/supervisor.tt

[3:59]  
then the first one there

[3:59]  
and then redis on your local machine

[4:00]  
probably gonna need to dl redis if you dont have it

[4:00]  
http://redis.io/topics/quickstart - i used those instructions

ammathew [4:00 PM]  
oh ... think ive had it up before

another tip when you begin debugging on a single feed - go into sf_web.feed_source and change the fetch_every = 1

ryan [4:36 PM]  
https://github.com/SocialFlowDev/SocialFlow-FeedSource/blob/master/lib/SocialFlow/FeedSource/Fetcher.pm#L250 also edit that function so that it only returns your feed, you can search by feed_id

[4:36]  
then the logs arent insane (edited)

look at where the feedfecher parser comes in...

last one was at sf_job_queue=> select * from work_queue_job where class like '%Video%' order by job_id desc limit 1;;

where is vid added onfront end?

server not loading

maybe have to revert setting SOCIALFLOW_WEB_PATH=~/yml?

yes, reverted bashrc and now starts up

upload video to fb from url??

create fb object with url in feed as url?



ammathew [3:38 PM]  
hey so mrss feed items contain urls of videos.... is there any need to upload to s3 from the url?

[3:38]  
a little confused by this video stuff heh

guru [3:39 PM]  
haha, no, i think we should do it similar to how we handle images from feeds

[3:39]  
pass in the url directly

ammathew [3:39 PM]  
ok cool


hoe does content_item->attachments get populated?

in content_item->meta?

  '[{"type":"video","filename":"806baec2-9c4b-a884-9cc1-bfb1756abff0.mov","thumbnail_url":"http://ammathew.home.saturn.sflow.us:4010/static/images/app/default-video-image.png"}]',

ammathew [4:33 PM]  
hey joe the module we're using to parse RSS feeds ( XML::Feed) doesnt seem to support MRSS feeds, but this other module XML::FeedPP does

[4:33]  
wondering if i can add it or something

joe [4:34 PM]  
oh interesting

patspeiser [4:34 PM]  
you may or something

joe [4:34 PM]  
looking

patspeiser [4:34 PM]  
but you cannot add it.

joe [4:35 PM]  
it hasnt been updated since 2011. i would say if theres a way to detect if something is an MRSS feed, and only use this module in that case

[4:35]  
versus switching over to it fully

[4:35]  
since xml::feed works really well for normal rss and atom feeds

ammathew [4:36 PM]  
wouldnt want to switch over everything to it

[4:36]  
yea...

joe [4:36 PM]  
is this a separate daemon?

[4:36]  
or it's like

[4:36]  
going to be part of feed fetcher?

ammathew [4:36 PM]  
seems like it'd be part of the feedfetcher

[4:36]  
though it is video

joe [4:36 PM]  
yeah, if this is the only lib that works for that stuff, sounds good to me

ammathew [4:36 PM]  
maybe youd want to put it in another daemon, i dunno

joe [4:37 PM]  
hehe, hard to say :) if it's doing the same basic shit then it can be in fetcher

ammathew [4:37 PM]

left it at MRSS.pm L67

so what did  want to do here?

make XML::RSS object?


my $rss = XML::RSS->new (version => '2.0'); 
MRSS IS A DIFFERENT VERSION THAN 2.0 ?? CANT GO ON WITH THIS?

his is version 1.5.1 of the Media RSS specification, a namespace for RSS 2.0 


so extend version 2.0


not working now that i stashed a bunch of stuff ... need to bring back to working state tomorrow

ammathew	[3:52 PM]  
hey having  a hard time finding this .... do u know where enclosure urls are used to post images (to fb for example ) ?

guru	[4:01 PM]  
like in the fb docs?

[4:01]  
for videos

ammathew	[4:01 PM]  
so i have a feed like this:

[4:01]  
https://www.nasa.gov/rss/dyn/lg_image_of_the_day.rss

[4:02]  
with something like this in there

[4:02]  
for each post

[4:02]  
enclosure url="http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/12-gemini_12_recovery-23jpg.jpg (757KB)

" length="775246" type="image/jpeg" />

[4:02]  
actually thought that the app made image posts out of these

[4:03]  
but dont actually see evidence of that

[4:03]  
thought u mentioned that once?

[4:03]  
seems like they just post as link posts?

guru	[4:04 PM]  
yeah, i dont think we do that for images.

[4:04]  
we only do link posts for fb

[4:04]  
and for twitter we scrape the link for images

[4:04]  
and then attach that a an image

ammathew	[4:04 PM]  
oh damn, dont know why i thought we did then

[4:05]  
but what we want now is to make video posts out of mrss feeds right?

guru	[4:06 PM]  
yeah, its weird that we skipped the image step and jumped to video

[4:06]  
i never thought about image enclosure urls either

ammathew	[4:06 PM]  
right i guess that's where i got confused

guru	[4:06 PM]  
oh (edited)

[4:06]  
but this should be fine

[4:06]  
facebook allows passing in a video url for a video post

[4:06]  
so if we pass in the enclosure url

[4:06]  
for videos

[4:06]  
it should work

ammathew	[4:07 PM]  
ok ... but is the video url thing used elsewhere on the site? dont see it on compose ....thought guess could try to put one in compose box itself

guru	[4:07 PM]  
its used in a way

[4:08]  
so from the compose box

[4:08]  
we upload the video to s3

[4:08]  
via front end

[4:08]  
and we pass that s3 url to fb

[4:08]  
in the worker

ammathew	[4:08 PM]  
ah right

[4:09]  
so do u think the video url should go into content item meta?

new messages
guru	[4:09 PM]  
https://github.com/SocialFlowDev/SocialFlow-WorkQueue/blob/master/lib/SocialFlow/WorkQueue/Runner/FacebookVideoPost.pm#L218


guru	[4:09 PM]  
https://github.com/SocialFlowDev/SocialFlow-WorkQueue/blob/master/lib/SocialFlow/WorkQueue/Runner/FacebookVideoPost.pm#L218

[4:10]  
i think it should be in the same spot as it is when a post is created from the compose

[4:10]  
which is meta right?

new messages
[4:10]  
yeah

[4:10]  
meta


meta

[4:10]  
so that way you wont need to make any changes in the worker

ammathew	[4:11 PM]  
but woudnt I have to because on that line it's assuming the video url will be an s3 url?


guru	[4:14 PM]  
hmm

[4:14]  
yeah

[4:14]  
so the worker checks the content_item_media table

[4:15]  
based on the content item id

[4:15]  
pulls the filename from there

[4:15]  
and creates the url

[4:16]  
this will be a bit tricky, so we would need to store the rss video url entry in content_item_media table and be able to display it in the queue on edit

[4:17]  
but since all this is currently done off filename


** discuss with joe and guru


guru	[4:17 PM]  
hey joe

joe	[4:17 PM]  
whats up

guru	[4:17 PM]  
for the mrss stuff

[4:17]  
since the idea is to get the enclosure url from the feed

[4:18]  
and pass that on to facebook

as a video post

[4:18]  
it becomes a bit tricky

[4:18]  
right now if you compose a video post it uploads it to s3

[4:18]  
and stores the filename in meta

[4:18]  
and in content_item_media

[4:19]  
so the queue edit display, SMR display, workqueue all is based off the video filename

[4:19]  
any idea what the smoothest way to use the rss video link in this would be?

joe	[4:20 PM]  
what do we show in queue edit display? can the user watch the video?

guru	[4:20 PM]  
yes

[4:21]  
the easiest way would be to if else all over the place

[4:21]  
but that sounds like a lot of work

joe	[4:22 PM]  
im looking at content_item_media and seeing weird stuff-

[4:22]  
why is that type video?

ammathew	[4:22 PM]  
hehe

guru	[4:22 PM]  
wow

[4:22]  
thats messed up

[4:22]  
when was that created?

joe	[4:22 PM]  
uhmm

[4:22]  
no create_Date on this table

[4:22]  
lol

[4:23]  
which is the right table? _media or _attachment?

guru	[4:23 PM]  
oh

[4:23]  
attachment

[4:23]  
not media

ammathew	[4:23 PM]  
content_item_media  doesnt get used?

guru	[4:23 PM]  
create_date          | 2012-02-26 13:15:23

[4:23]  
so thats ok :slightly_smiling_face:

joe	[4:23 PM]  
hahaha

[4:23]  
ok good!

guru	[4:23 PM]  
for the bee post

ammathew	[4:23 PM]  
someone really effed up back in 2012

joe	[4:23 PM]  
lol

guru	[4:23 PM]  
i blame missy

[4:23]  
and andy

ammathew	[4:23 PM]  
i blame andy

guru	[4:23 PM]  
and brianlai

ammathew	[4:24 PM]  
hehe

joe	[4:24 PM]  
well, if our plan is to try to keep the video file on its host server and just send that url to facebook,

[4:24]  
maybe we store the full url in filename

[4:24]  
and then in code we're just like

[4:25]  
if (URI->new($attachment->filename)->is_absolute) { [ this is an mrss upload, treat filename like a full url ] } else { this is just a filename, build s3 url }

[4:25]  
and that can be a helper function in the contentItemAttachment result.pm

[4:25]  
->media_url() or something

guru	[4:26 PM]  
cool

joe	[4:26 PM]  
so, the content importer would create the content_item_attachment entry and add the appropriate info to content_item.meta

guru	[4:26 PM]  
ammathew yeah content_item_media isnt used anymore

[4:26]  
joe yeah that makes sense

joe	[4:27 PM]  
i dont know if it would make things more complicated to create a new attachment type or not

[4:27]  
it might make sense to leave it as video, at least to start w/

guru	[4:27 PM]  
a new content type would make it hard to include on the pub page

joe	[4:27 PM]  
hehe yeah i figured :)

[4:27]  
ok cool

[4:28]  
does the frontend build s3 urls in queue editing? would need to have similar logic there and on SMR i guess

guru	[4:28 PM]  
yeah it does

joe	[4:28 PM]  
maybe we can try to centralize that to a single js function just like how it will be a single function in backend code?

[4:28]  
content_item_attachment_url() and do similar shit

guru	[4:28 PM]  
yeah

ammathew	[4:29 PM]  
cool, ill start working on that then




need it on feed entry table?

another column on feed entry table?


use FeedPP after feed entry already created?

** not indicated if feedentry entries contain video


ammathew	[5:56 PM]  
hey...so another issue is that theres no way to know from the feed_entry table right now if the entry came from an mrss feed

[5:56]  
or contains a video

guru	[5:57 PM]  
umm is there a column somewhere where we can store info that its an mrss feed?

[5:57]  
or a config maybe

[5:57]  
so we check if that feed has that config set

ammathew	[5:59 PM]  
no relevant columne in feed_source at least

[5:59]  
as for config...

[5:59]  
maybe?



sf_web=> select * from feed_source_config_parameter limit 1;
 feed_source_id | config_parameter_id |  value   
----------------+---------------------+----------
              1 |                   6 | post_all



fidn feed source configs




ammathew	[5:59 PM]  
no relevant columne in feed_source at least

[5:59]  
as for config...

[5:59]  
maybe?

[6:03]  
theres a table called feed_source_config_parameter fwiw

guru	[6:04 PM]  
yeah, i think thats what we can use

ammathew	[6:06 PM]  
there is also a "feed_type" on the feed table

[6:06]  
indicated Atom, RSS etc ... but

[6:07]  
MRSS is technically just an RSS feed...

guru	[6:07 PM]  
ah ok, so we cant use that?

ammathew	[6:07 PM]  
dont know...dont know if it's wise to hehe

[6:07]  
maybe ask joe or same tomm....

new messages
guru	[6:08 PM]  
yeah


./lib/SocialFlow/API/Controller/FeedSource.pm:                    $feed_source->feed_source_config_parameters->create( {

start tomorrow with adding config to a feed to indicate that it is an mrss feed


* 11/16

how do feed configs work?

    my $default_import_config =
        $c->model("SocialFlowApp::ConfigParameter")
        ->find( { name => "FeedSource::initial_import_rule" } );


config paramenter or feed type

look at feed type

type seems like proper place for this

http://ammathew.home.saturn.sflow.us:4010/api/feed_source/add

where are feeds added to sf_feed_source.feed?

revert to MRSS feed
